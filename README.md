Create a personal website for me, it should be dynamic, clean and have a professional UI. I want to use my picture in data, and need a bio highlighting my work in CV provided in main.tex, highlighting my education and current work at apple. I want to host it on kanikadhiman.github.io 

I wish to link my linkedin, email, and cv right below my bio.

Then I'd like to highlight and discuss my industrial experience. I want to use images of the companies I worked with, beautifully integrated with a brief experience. CLicking on images should open their main websites. 

I'd like to highlight my education in a similar way. I want to use images of the universities I attended, beautifully integrated with a brief education. 

Feel free to use the browser to look up the images of the companies and universities I worked with and attended.
